  *Laptop Request Catalog Item*

*Introduction*

The *Laptop Request Catalog Item* provides employees with an automated and user-friendly way to request laptops for work. Traditionally, the laptop provisioning process has been manual, leading to delays, incomplete data, and lack of visibility. By implementing a digital catalog item within the organization’s Service Portal, employees can easily submit requests with guided form behavior, while IT teams can efficiently process and track them.

---

 *Objective*

To streamline and automate the laptop request process by enabling employees to request laptops through a dynamic, rule-based Service Catalog item that ensures data accuracy, governance, and efficient fulfillment.

---

 *Key Goals*

* Simplify the laptop request process for end-users.
* Enable *dynamic form behavior* (fields show/hide based on user selections).
* Ensure *data accuracy* and *validation* before submission.
* Provide *IT teams* with clear, actionable requests.
* Enable *tracking, approval, and fulfillment workflows*.
* Maintain *auditability* for governance and deployment management.

---

 *Features*

1. *Dynamic Form Fields* – The form adapts based on user input (e.g., type of laptop, justification, role).
2. *Reset Form Functionality* – Allows users to clear all fields and restart easily.
3. *Pre-populated User Details* – Automatically fills requester information using ServiceNow user profile data.
4. *Approval Workflow* – Routes requests to managers for approval before IT provisioning.
5. *Attachments Section* – Option to upload additional documents or justification forms.
6. *Auto-generated Tasks* – Creates fulfillment tasks for IT staff once approved.
7. *Notification System* – Sends email/SMS updates to requester and approvers.
8. *Governance & Audit Trail* – Tracks all changes and approvals for compliance.

*Implementation Steps*

1. *Create the Catalog Item*

   * Navigate to Service Catalog → Maintain Items and create “Laptop Request”.
   * Add fields like: Laptop Type, Purpose, Department, Urgency, and Delivery Location.

2. *Configure Variable Sets*

   * Group related variables (e.g., Laptop Specs, User Info).
   * Apply *UI Policies* for dynamic visibility (e.g., show model options based on selected brand).

3. *Add Client Scripts*

   * Implement JavaScript for dynamic field behavior and form reset button functionality.

4. *Define Workflows*

   * Use *Flow Designer* or *Workflow Editor* to design approval and fulfillment flow.
   * Add manager approval → asset team task creation → delivery confirmation.

5. *Set Notifications*

   * Configure email templates for request submission, approval, and completion events.

6. *Access Control*

   * Apply *ACLs (Access Control Lists)* to ensure only employees can submit requests.

---

*Testing and Deployment*

* *Unit Testing:* Validate each field’s visibility, reset functionality, and form submission.
* *Integration Testing:* Ensure end-to-end workflow (request → approval → fulfillment) works correctly.
* *UAT (User Acceptance Testing):* Conduct testing with sample employees.
* *Deployment:* Move the catalog item and associated flows from development → test → production using Update Sets.

---

*Workflow Automations*

* *Approval Automation:* Automatically route to the requester’s manager for approval.
* *Task Generation:* Upon approval, create tasks for IT hardware provisioning.
* *Notification Triggers:* Email notifications at each workflow stage.
* *Auto-Close Mechanism:* Automatically close the request once all tasks are marked completed.

---

*Example and Use Case*

*Scenario:*
An employee named Alex Johnson requires a laptop for remote work.

* He opens the Service Portal and selects *Laptop Request*.
* Chooses *Laptop Type: MacBook Pro, and provides the justification: *“Required for software development.”
* The form dynamically shows available configurations and delivery options.
* On submission, the request is sent to his manager for approval.
* Once approved, IT receives an automatic task to assign and deliver the laptop.
* Alex receives notifications throughout the process until fulfillment is complete.

---

 *Reports and KPIs*

* *Total Laptop Requests per Month*
* *Approval Time (Average Time for Manager Approval)*
* *Fulfillment SLA Compliance (%)*
* *Request-to-Delivery Time (Average)*
* *Most Requested Laptop Models*
* *Pending vs. Completed Requests*

These KPIs help IT management identify bottlenecks, forecast asset needs, and improve service efficiency.
